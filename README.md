# inTouch Front-End

## Description

If you're like most people, it's getting harder and harder to create and nurture deep, meaningful relationships as we transfer our social lives to digital media. If you're like most people, you want to do something about it.

**InTouch** is a minimalist app designed to help you stay connected with people you care about. It's not a social media network or an automated communications system. You don't set it and forget it. It's more like a friend who reminds you to reach out to your loved ones now and then in meaningful ways.

This is the **official Frontend application for InTouch.**
